# Dockerfiles for obolibrary/odk{full,lite}

This folder containers Dockerfiles for building the images here:

https://hub.docker.com/r/obolibrary/

We make two: odklite and odkfull. See individual folders for details.
The odk depends on odkfull.

Note that these containers are not intended to be built as part of the
ontology generation process. They are here for obo admins to make and
release the docker images required for odk to work.
